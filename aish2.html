        <p class="para2">I was watching a movie today... don't really remember the name. It is weird, because it has just been a few minutes since the movie got over. The real reason why I don't remember the name is, I wasn't really interested in watching it in the first place. Today is a Sunday... didn't want it to be like any regular weekday. I wanted to go out, do something because, i mostly don't go out of the house now-a-days and it is really depressing to sit at home all the time. But yeah, after this movie I realized, maybe things donâ€™t always go the way you want them to. It is okay to "go with the flow of life" and not go out of your way all the time and make things happen. I actually started enjoying the movie.</p>
        
        <p class="para2">Nothing in the world can bring you happiness. Not when you get into the university you worked hard to get into, not when you land in your dream job, not when you get the guy/girl of your dreams, not even when you become a millionaire. Even then, you will find more goals you didn't achieve yet and more problems to deal with. Your real happiness begins with you. It is right there, inside you, waiting for you to discover it. Find something you can do that makes you happy, and DO IT. It doesn't matter even if it is something small like, watching a movie, listening to songs, writing, drawing, anything. Have something to look forward to, and that will keep you going. Life is not meant for achieving anything, but for living it.</p>
        
        <p class="para2">You are not supposed to have everything figured out in life. I always thought i must have a plan, a back-up plan and another one to back-up the back-up plan, and things would work out. But, NO! Life is not a project. There is no plan that can make your life go the way you want it to. You are supposed to figure everything out yourself and that is the beauty of it.</p>
        
        <p class="para2">Realizing this does not solve your problems. It just helps you deal with them. You will get want you want. All those goals will be met, but until then just live, every moment.</p>
