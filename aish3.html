        <p class="para2">FREEDOM...</p>
        
        <p class="para2">It is to be able to dream and make them real without any constraints, To grow in the very direction you want to, without any chains pulling you back, to be able to do the things that make you happier, without the fear of being judged. Freedom is basically the right to be yourself.</p>
        
        <p class="para2">But sometimes, the whole concept of freedom is misunderstood, especially when it comes to relationships... be it marriage or any committed relationship for that matter. When you are in a relationship, you are in an EQUAL PARTNERSHIP. You look out for each other, understand your partner's priorities as well, and make decisions and adjustments in a mature way. You are not just two independent individuals anymore. You are contingent on each other and it is not just your life anymore, but it is both of your LIFE.</p>
        
        <p class="para2">This sounds scary isn't it? Well, it is really not! Your freedom does not vanish in a relationship. Your priorities change. This is the difference people need to understand. Often freedom is confused with adjustments. You make adjustments to achieve what you want, and that is not being deprived of freedom. No one can have everything in life. You let go of certain things to get some other things because, those "other things" are now your priority.</p>

        <p class="para2">When you get committed in a relationship, you are making a choice, by choosing "us" over "me". The things you do and the adjustments you make to keep each other happy are a part of this. No one can ever force you to keep doing anything. You are doing that thing because, somewhere in your heart, you want to do this! So, why not do this in a full fledged way? When you understand that human relationships are way above all exaggerated self opinions, you find a better self.</p>

        <p class="para2">You, as a grown-up individual are making a choice on your own, in full consciousness (unless you get committed or married when you are drunk or high). Is this not freedom?</p>

        <p class="para2">The very minute you feel that your freedom is vanishing, you need to realize that it is you, who has to change. Your freedom lies completely within you. No person in this world can neither give it to you, nor take it away from you.</p>
